### Shiny App - Pitch 

Let us present a little app that gathers the various aspects of Data Analysis with R we've tackle during the Data analytics course.

- Data loading
- Data cleaning
- Features selection
- Features analysis with graphics

__Context__ : "A real estate investor is looking forward to using this data in order to take a decision regarding the best option he has in real estate to generate profit on Airbnb from his investment."

__Data__ : Airbnb Records from http://insideairbnb.com

__tools__ : [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html), [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com), [slidy2](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/#(1))

                          Pierre-Mathieu Barras - Marius Sorrin - Camille Marini


### Overview - Subject 

- We have to take care to select the best possible features and graphics to make effective decision making : **availability, price and revenue**

- As real estate investors, we selected some indicators to be able to compare the cities with each other (and their neigborhoods)

- For the sake of simplicity we have only selected Western European cities for the moment.


            sample_cities <- c('Mallorca','Antwerp','Sevilla','Napoli')
            


### Preprocessing  : getting data and prepare it

A part of the script were given but we added some functions


![](CLient.png)

### App architecture - server and ui

- The UI part organizes the general layout, bind the inputs (**city, features to compare, graphics and metrics selection**) and render the outputs (**plots, specific values**)

- The server part **catches the UI inputs** to do the computations and **sends the results back to the UI as outputs**. Other underlying functions could be implemented (Zoom function for exemple)

- We split the analysis of our application in two parts:
    - A quick analysis to differentiate between cities (*which city to invest in ?*)
    - A more detailed analysis of a specific city (*what kind of investment in that city ?*) 

### Graphical analysis - quick view and global comparaisons

A quick analysis to differentiate between cities (*which city to invest in ?*)

  - select one or more city 
  - select the indicator (availability, price, revenue)
  - selec an aggregation type
  - overlay one other critera

![](part1.png)`


### Graphical analysis - quick view and global comparaisons

- The investor can use 3 differents graphics : **Boxplot, Histogram and density function**
![](box.png)![](hist.png)![](density.png)

- To easy the comparaison, it's possible to **overlay the graphics of dfferent cities** an even **add dimensions**
![](3cities.png)![](dims.png)

- when there are too many features, the graphics quickly become unreadable, so it is possible to **zoom in and out**
![](zoom-.png)![](zoom+.png)


### Graphical analysis - deep dive into a specific city
A more detailed analysis of a specific city (*what kind of investment in that city ?*) 

![](part2.png)

First you can compare any metric over 10 neigborhoods, the room types and the numbers of bedrooms at the same time.
![](finer.png)

You can also plot a map to better understand the distribution within cities
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
defaultW <- getOption("warn")
options(warn = -1)
listings_small <- listings[c(1:1000), ]
listings_small %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(popup = as.character(listings_small$revenue_365),clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
options(warn = defaultW)
```


### Bonus - Break Even Point analysis, Zoom function
- The period in years when the investement starts to generates benefits for the investor.
- Approach based on fixed costs and variable costs.
- Estimation of more profitable cities.

```{r, message=FALSE}
defaultW <- getOption("warn")
options(warn = -1)
listings$bep_year[listings$bep_year>100] <- 100
distrib_bep_year <- ggplot(listings, aes(city, bep_year))
distrib_bep_year + geom_boxplot(aes(colour = "red"), outlier.shape = NA) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = quantile(listings$bep_year, c(0.1, 0.9), na.rm = T))
options(warn = defaultW)
```


### Conclusion 
- Our application is meant to help investors **compare cities and neigborhoods**
- Once the city is selected, the investor can make precision about the kind of asset to invest in and the neigborhood.
- It provides specific metrics **at glance**
- Currently the App is limited to **4** cities for memory purposes
- We would improve the app by adding more cities and select and process cities' data **on the fly**
- And improve data visualisation  with math functions : **availability predictions, revenue estimation...**
- We shared this app in a simplified version on https://karhyus.shinyapps.io/final_projet_sorrin_marini_barras/ and the whole project is available on https://github.com/Ducrioma/DataAnalysisApp
- **Now the demo**

```{r, message=FALSE}
defaultW <- getOption("warn")
options(warn = -1)
listings_malaga <- listings[city=='malaga', ]
listings_malaga$bep_year[listings_malaga$bep_year>100] <- 100
g <- ggplot(listings_malaga, aes(bep_year,revenue_365))
g + geom_smooth(method = lm) + labs(x="Break Even Point in Year", y='Revenue per Year')
options(warn = defaultW)
```

DataAnalysisApp is light `shiny app` that allows `investors` to do `decide whether a city is worth investing`.
This app is based in Airbnb data fetch [in here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

This project is a small tool with no application in the scientific world.
Meaning this can't help you becoming a millionier on the moon...
